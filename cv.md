## Summary

My main goal is to get basic development skills with which I could more confidently develop further as a developer. For me the priority is knowledge, and if they give it to me, I never refuse.

One of my strengths is determination. In addition, I can work well in a team.

I have no work experience, but I have a great desire and aspiration to learn a lot of new things, which would help me to find a profession.
